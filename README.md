<!-- Images are build by Docker HUB Build directly connected to the GIT Hub git hook -->

# Hello World
This GIT repo and image is used for versioning and deployment testing in extreemly simple CICD pipelines.

# How it works
The docker image created includes the html page displaying a version number. This version number is controlled by the VERSION environment variable (which in itself can be controlled by any other external effects like Jenkins). </br>
The page can be views on port 80.
